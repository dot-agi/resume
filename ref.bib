abstract="Vision Transformers are increasingly embedded in industrial systems due to their superior performance, but their memory and power requirements make deploying them to edge devices a challenging task. Hence, model compression techniques are now widely used to deploy models on edge devices as they decrease the resource requirements and make model inference very fast and efficient. But their reliability and robustness from a security perspective are major issues in safety-critical applications. Adversarial attacks are like optical illusions for ML algorithms and they can severely impact the accuracy and reliability of models. In this work, we investigate the performance of adversarial attacks across the Vision Transformer model compressed using 3 SOTA compression techniques. We also analyze the effect different compression techniques like Quantization, Pruning, and Weight Multiplexing have on the transferability of adversarial attacks.",

abstract={Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) blends advantages of both Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) in a single framework. It provides accelerated learning capacity and adaptive interpretation capabilities to model complex patterns and apprehends nonlinear relationships. ANFIS has been applied and practiced in various domains and provided solutions to commonly recurring problems with improved time and space complexity. Standard ANFIS has certain limitations such as high computational expense, loss of interpretability in larger inputs, curse of dimensionality, and selection of appropriate membership functions. This paper summarizes that the standard ANFIS is unsuitable for complex human tasks that require precise handling of machines and systems. The state-of-the-art and practice research questions have been discussed, which primarily focus on the applicability of ANFIS in the diversifying field of engineering sciences. We conclude that the standard ANFIS architecture is vastly improved when amalgamated with metaheuristic techniques and further moderated with nature-inspired algorithms through calibration and tuning of parameters. It is significant in adapting and automating complex engineering tasks that currently depend on human discretion, prominent in the mechanical, electrical, and geological fields.},
